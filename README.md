# web-search-agent
AI agents for web search using local LLMs - materials from my ATxSG 2025 presentation. This repo demonstrates building search agents that can understand queries, search the web via Tavily API, and synthesize results using locally-run language models. Includes code and slides showing practical implementation with LangChain, LangGraph, and Ollama.
