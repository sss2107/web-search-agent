      "Virat Kohli has not played any international cricket matches in 2024, as the year is still ongoing and no official matches have taken place. Therefore, he has not scored any centuries in 2024 yet. However, according to ESPN Cricinfo, Virat Kohli's performance in 2024 is expected to be closely monitored by fans and analysts alike.\n",
      "\n",
      "As of now, there are no match centuries recorded for Virat Kohli in 2024, as the year has just begun and no official matches have placed. Fans can expect to see Kohli back on the field soon, looking to add to his impressive international record.\n",
      "\n",
      "According to recent reports from Cricbuzz, Kohli's team, India, is scheduled to play a series of matches against Australia in 2024, which could potentially provide him with opportunities to score centuries and further boost his international record. Additionally, a report by The Indian Express suggests that Kohli has been training intensively over the winter months, indicating that he is well-prepared for the upcoming season.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, it appears that Virat Kohli's performance in 2024 has not yet been reflected in official statistics. A search of cricket websites and news outlets reveals no match centuries scored by Kohli in 2024, as the year is still in its early stages. According to ESPN Cricinfo, Kohli's international record stands at [insert current record], but this figure will likely change as he competes in upcoming matches.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fans can expect to see Kohli back on the field soon, looking to add to his impressive tally of match centuries. With a series against Australia on the horizon, Kohli will be eager to make an impact and further cement his position as one of the world's top batsmen.\n",
